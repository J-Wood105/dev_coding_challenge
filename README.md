# DOSE Junior Developer Coding Challenge

This is your opportunity to show us what you are capabale of!  We are looking for developers who :
- Write clean, well structured code
- Have attention to detail
- Are creative

## Introducing DOSE Digital Assistant

For this coding challenge you're going to take on Siri, Alexa, and Google!

Create a single page web application that takes a voice command such as "DOSE, show me music" or "DOSE, show me food".  The application will then redirect the user to the appropriate tag page on dose.com : [music](https://dose.com/tagged/music), [food](https://dose.com/tagged/food)

It turns out you won't exactly be taking on Google for this challange as you'll be using one of their products for the voice recognition part of it.  [API.AI](https://api.ai/) is a free service that provides voice recognition capabilities via an API.  You'll need to create a free account there and then get started with the appropriate [SDK](https://docs.api.ai/docs/sdks).

## Submitting Your Solution

To submit your code exercise:
- Fork this repository
- Implement your solution in the fork
- Submit a pull request back to this repository with your solution (we won't actually be merging the request, but it lets us know you can perform basic git workflow).

## Bonus Points

Here's how to get bonus ponts:
- Host the project on something like [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
- Include good documentation on how to build your app.
- Provide tests for your app.
- Use [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for the UI (that's what we use here).
- Make your app as compact as possible using something like [Webpack])[https://webpack.github.io/] or [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/).
